This repository contains java classes that come together to create a text based word guessing game. The current bank of words to be guessed is stored in a text file.
This project employs proper object orientation practices. Objects are created when they are needed and certain methods are hidden from the end user. 
The word to be guessed is randomized and the user has 3 attempts to spell the word correctly.
"dev" is the current working branch where the classes can be found.
